## ‚öôÔ∏è Concept Highlights

- **Magnetically Driven Motion**  
  Uses strategically positioned permanent magnets to rotate gears without direct mechanical contact.

- **Axle-Induced Electricity Generation**  
  Gear rotation transfers torque to a central axle connected to a generator, creating electric current.

- **Non-Combustive Energy Source**  
  All propulsion driven by magnetic fields ‚Äî no motors, fuel, or combustion involved.

- **Passive Mechanical System**  
  Simple structure with minimal moving parts for low-maintenance exploration.

- **Scalable for Low-Power Applications**  
  Ideal for powering microcontrollers, LEDs, or sensors in experimental setups.

- **Hands-On STEM Exploration**  
  A great way to explore magnetism, electromechanics, and creative engineering design.

## Project Goals

- Validate torque transfer from magnetic gears to central axle
